            <p>"Crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside, these salmon nuggets are finished off with a sweet chipotle-maple
            drizzle. These make a great appetizer and are also tasty served over greens. Try and find center-cut salmon filets that
            are at least 1-inch thick. I usually buy extra salmon, and trim off the thinner outer edges, saving for another use. I
            like to use a MistoÂ® sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray."</p>

                <ul class="salmon">
                    <li>1/3 cup maple syrup</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
                    <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups butter- and garlic-flavored croutons</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 (1 pound) skinless, center-cut salmon fillet, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
                    <li>cooking spray</li>

                <h3 class="salmon-sub">Steps:</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Combine maple syrup, chipotle powder, and salt in saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat to low to keep warm.</li>
                    <li>Place croutons in the bowl of a mini food processor; pulse until crushed into fine crumbs. Transfer to a shallow bowl.
                    Whisk egg in a separate bowl.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle salmon lightly with sea salt. Lightly dip salmon into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Coat salmon in
                    crouton breading and shake off extra. Set on a plate and mist lightly with cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Spray basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Place salmon nuggets inside, working in batches to avoid overcrowding,
                    if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 3 minutes. Gently turn salmon pieces, spray lightly with oil, and cook until salmon
                    is cooked throughout, 3 to 4 more minutes. Place on a serving platter and drizzle with warm chipotle-maple syrup. Serve
                    immediately.</li>
                </ol>
